# Limited Things

`凡可言者，皆可穷尽矣`  

Everything that can be described is a finite thing

`文之所书，可殆矣`

All textual descriptions are also limited

`穷经皓首，至极矣`

There is a limit to the amount of text a person can understand throughout their lifetime

`取可得书海者之一篇，蜉蝣者也`

In a short lifetime, choose a small point from the permutation and combination of possible words

`于此，吾著造化者，其虽伪物，但已类人`

Here I have written about a great worker who, although he is an imitator, has already approached humans

# Creator Like

``` c++

void action_out_word();
void action_in_word();
void action_write();
void action_read();
void action_call();

void main()
{
while(true)
switch(rand()){
case 0: action_out_word();break;
case 1: action_in_word();break;
case 2: action_write();break;
case 3: action_read();break;
case 4: action_call();break;
default:return;
}}

```

# Author's remarks
```
人的一切创作，都是在有限的文字排列组合中选择一种可能性，让这种可能性从虚无的概率变成物质的排布，无论具备什么样的意义，无非如此。

对于人而言，文字只是排列组合，不过不同的排列组合会对不同的人产生不同的影响。于是便产生了文字本身对人产生了影响的幻觉。

所谓文章本天成 妙手偶得之。文字的排列组合就存在于可能性之中，只不过通过人的智慧选择出了其中一些对人影响较大的排列组合。

这就像是在一个接近无穷的数据库中检索基于某种排序算法进行排序后的第一个选择。

人的智慧就是这种检索算法。

All human creations are made by choosing a possibility from a limited arrangement of words, transforming it from an empty probability into a material arrangement, regardless of its significance.

For people, text is just a combination of permutations, but different combinations of permutations can have different impacts on different people. So there is the illusion that the text itself has an impact on people.

The so-called article is naturally acquired by a skilled hand. The arrangement and combination of words exist in possibilities, but some of them have a significant impact on people through human wisdom.

This is like retrieving the first choice after sorting based on a certain sorting algorithm in a nearly infinite database.

Human intelligence is this search algorithm.
